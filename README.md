This is a C# project.

We use kinect to collect 3D data for us and try to draw the picture on the screen. And finally we will save the picture trace and try to use a 3D printer to print the model for us.

The main steps of this project are as follows:
1. draw in 2D without high demanding of memory
2. try to show the picture with a 3D effect
3. try to save the 3D file
